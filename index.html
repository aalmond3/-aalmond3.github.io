        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>I was set on going to a small community college in Western Washginton. I thought I had made my final choice and was preapred to take my next steps when my best friend of the time asked me if I wanted to tour Eastern with her. It took approx 30 minutes of me walking around campus to decide I wanted to go to an actual university rather than just a community college (they were going to cost around the same anyways). Eastern is the one and only school I applied to and I am happy I made the choice I did. I love my major and I can see growth every single day!</p>
